## Odin todo-list

This was a real challenge to implement, and the complexity of the project scaled very fast.

I found myself wanting to change how I implemented many of the objects after already using them in several other places. Much of the time spent was probably in changing the implementation or interface of an object, followed by fixing the cascade of other dependencies that immediately crashed. Time to learn TypeScript and TDD!

P.S. Adding localStorage at the end was really satisfying.
